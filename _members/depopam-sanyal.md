I am a PhD student in Computer Science [SCS] at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I specialize in machine learning and systems under the supervision of Prof. Alexey Tumanov. My current research interests are in: a) systems support for federated learning b) efficient and secure machine learning inference.

I received my master's degree in Computer Science and my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, both from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was advised by Prof. Sibin Mohan.

In the past, I spent two summers as a research intern in the Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During my undergraduate studies, I spent two years as a part-time researcher at National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
